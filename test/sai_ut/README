README for running unit-tests for SAI

## Dependency  ##

We rely on google-test infrastructure to run these unit-tests. Download 
google-test from this location
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/downloads/list
update the pointer to gtest in the Makefile. Build gtest lib target from
the common Makefile inside 'sai/test' directory.

We also rely on SAI library which are _your_ implementation of the SAI API
Update the pointer to SAI library and other Linking flags in Makefile
Update the pointer to the SAI API Include directory, if necessary.
By default, the relative path to the inc/ folder as in OCP github dir. structure
is added in the Makefile.

## Building unit-tests ##

Add your unit-test sources to *_SRCS in the Makefile.
Some unit-test files are already added, which tests SAI router, 
router interface, route, nexthop, neighbor, nexthop group objects as seperate
binaries.

## Running unit-tests ##
After building with "make all", one binary/executable (*_EXEC variable in Makefile)
is generated for each SAI API in the 'sai/test/bin' directory. 
Place this binary/executable on the switch, along with the SAI library, and run the executable. It outputs a 
PASS/FAIL per testcase, which can be used to validate the test run

## Alternative environments for running the unit-test ##
P4 test framework and soft switch - TBD
